Task: Automated Food Warehouse Robot Design
For this task, I was asked to design a fully autonomous robot system that could manage operations inside a food warehouse without human involvement. I had to write a clear implementation algorithm, describe how the robot would be built, and explain the elements of its working envelope.


1. Implementation Algorithm

   1. Initialize the robot and run self-checks on sensors and components.
   2. Load the list of food items and their storage locations from the database.
   3. Begin navigation using obstacle-avoidance sensors and warehouse mapping.
   4. Locate the specific food item using camera or RFID.
   5. Align and position the robot's arm to pick up the food item.
   6. Grip and lift the food item carefully.
   7. Move to the target storage shelf using shortest path planning.
   8. Position the arm and place the item in the correct shelf.
   9. Update the system database with the item’s new location.
   10. Repeat the process for the next item or return to standby.


2. Robot Design
   
   - Base: Four-wheeled platform for stable movement.
   - Motors: Servo motors to control movement and turning.
   - Sensors:
      - Ultrasonic/IR sensors for obstacle detection
      - Camera or barcode scanner for identifying food items
      - Temperature/humidity sensors for environment monitoring
   - Arm:
      - 5-DOF robotic arm with gripper to pick and place items
      - Lift capability of ~5kg
   - Controller:
      - Arduino or Raspberry Pi to control the robot
   - Power Supply:
      - Rechargeable battery or power dock system
   - Connectivity:
      - Wi-Fi or Bluetooth for real-time communication with warehouse database


3. Working Envelope Elements

   - The robot operates within a 10m x 20m warehouse floor.
   - The robotic arm has a 1.5-meter horizontal reach.
   - It can lift items from ground level up to 1.2 meters high.
   - The base can rotate 360°, and the arm can rotate 180° horizontally.
   - Maximum payload: 5 kilograms per item.
   - Movement speed: 0.5–1 m/s depending on obstacle density.


Reflection:
This task helped me break down a real-world automation scenario into specific robotic actions. It gave me a better understanding of how path planning, sensors, robotic arms, and control systems all come together in warehouse automation. Designing both the logic and physical capabilities of the robot helped me think like both an engineer and a systems planner.
